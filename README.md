Cut_List_generator
==================

This is the Python script for making cut lists for processing cut to length bar and plate

The simple version allows for entering part lengths and stock length directly into the console.  It is good for small cut lists and for when using a single stock length.

The Ultra version is for multiple stock lengths and larger part quantities.  A list of parts to be cut is created in a file called CutListParts.txt and the stock lengths are created in another file.  It will also write the cut list to another file if asked to do so.
